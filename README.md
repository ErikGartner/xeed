# XEED
XEED is a tool that organizes role-playing settings. It focuses on story driven games and does not have map support.

## Usage

### Installation
XEED uses maven for building executable jars with bundled dependencies.
```
mvn package
```
It will generate a ```target/``` folder with the compiled jars.

### Running
Depending on the host system either double click on the built jar files or type:
```
java -jar XEED.jar
```

## Tests
None at the moment but they should be stored in ```src/test/java/```.
