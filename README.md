# XEED
*XEED is a tool that organizes role-playing settings. It focuses on story driven games and does not have map support.*

The goal of XEED is to help the game master to store and organize the vast amount of data in a roleplaying setting. The main focus is the characters and their most important traits such as background, personality, relations and factions/groups rather than individual stats. XEED is written in Java and aims at being platform independent.

## Key Features
- A modular template system that allows XEED to adapt to a variety of games.
- User can create their own character templates.
- A customizable main window; display only the data need.
- Organize your notes, groups, characters and relationships in one compact file format.
- Visualize your data with graphs.
- An autosave function ensures your data is safe in case of crashes.
- Optional autoupdate feature that updates to the latest version.
- Export your setting information to HTML, PDF or TXT.

## Usage

### Installation
XEED uses maven for building executable jars with bundled dependencies.
```
mvn package
```
It will generate a ```target/``` folder with the compiled jars.

### Running
Depending on the host system either double click on the built jar files or type:
```
java -jar XEED.jar
```

## Tests
None at the moment but they should be stored in ```src/test/java/```.

Pull requests are welcome. Main developer is @erik_gartner.

### Problems
This project is very old and suffers from incorrect code conventions, bad patterns and a tangled structure. Fixing these problem should be considered high priority before developing new features.

For example:
- Variables have the type as prefix.
- Methods start with a capital letter.
- The coupling is very high.
- Potential threading problem.
- Propagating changes between forms is mess.
- Main class is way to big and contains and breaks many OOP principles.

Despite these problem the program is generally stable and extended usage over several years have only revealed minor bugs.
